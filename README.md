# Imposter Syndrome Code Samples
Code samples written by me for Imposter Syndrome, a 3D 1st-person role-playing game about a robot who is trying to impersonate a human. Navigate around your new home without being too suspicious! Coming into contact with water or failing human tasks can increase your suspicion level, which can cause some unexpected effects on your controls.\
 \
This game was developed using the Unity game engine.\
 \
The repository hosting the entire project is currently privated.\
